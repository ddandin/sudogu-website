            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Sudogu ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Sudogu app.</p>
            <p>Sudogu is operated by the app's developer, who is responsible for the collection and processing of data described in this policy.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect minimal information to provide you with the best gaming experience:</p>

            <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Username:</strong> If you choose to participate in the global leaderboard, you may provide a username to display your scores.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Participation in the leaderboard is optional. You may choose not to submit a username and still fully enjoy the app.</p>

            <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Game Progress:</strong> We store your game progress, scores, and statistics locally on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaderboard Data:</strong> If you submit scores to our leaderboard, we collect your username and score.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect limited, non-identifying device information such as device type and operating system version solely to ensure app compatibility and improve performance. This information is not used to identify individual users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide and maintain the Sudogu app</li>
                <li>Display your scores on the global leaderboard</li>
                <li>Save your game progress and preferences</li>
                <li>Improve and optimize the app's performance</li>
                <li>Respond to your inquiries and support requests</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>Your game progress and preferences are stored locally on your device. Leaderboard data is stored on our secure servers. We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Our app does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties. Sudogu does not track users across apps or websites, and does not sell personal data.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Sudogu is suitable for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The only personal information optionally collected is a username for the leaderboard feature, which does not require real names or identifying information.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access the information we have about you</li>
                <li>Request deletion of your leaderboard data</li>
                <li>Opt out of the leaderboard feature</li>
                <li>Clear your local game data at any time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Local game data is retained on your device until you delete the app or clear the data. Leaderboard data (username and score) is retained for a maximum of 7 days and is automatically deleted after this period. Users may also request deletion of their leaderboard data at any time by contacting us.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
